move-border.el
==============

`move-border.el` provides functions for window resizing, considering the current
window border instead of the window itself.

So, by binding your keys to `move-border-down`, `move-border-up`,
`move-border-left`, and `move-border-right`, you can resize your windows much more
intuitively than if you where using `shrink-window`, `enlarge-window`,
`shrink-window-horizontally` and `enlarge-window-horizontally`.
